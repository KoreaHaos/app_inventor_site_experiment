# Haos Torn Down : MIT App Inventor

I find the App Inventor Site a bit inefficent.

I wonder ...

* First try : Copy/Paste source and move assets in as needed.
    * Problems :
        * Doesn't work so well...

* Second Try ( in test2 folder of first commit) : Download Site and host it myself.
    * This has much better results.
    * Can view images, projects, ect.
    * Problems :
    * needs content request as https
    * There is a id of some sort being generated and used in the URL.
    * 

* Conclusions :
    * This is probably do able.
    * Needs a bit more time than the five or ten minutes i gave it.

* Move Forward Possibilities :
    * See how open the source is.
    * hack at it.

* Goal :
    * Re-create the features i want for my use.
